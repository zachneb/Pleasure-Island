      <h2>Kure Beach</h2>
      <p>Kure (Cur-ee) Beach is Carolina Beach's friendly neighbor to the south.  The town was established 
        in 1870 with Hans Kure's arrival from Denmark.  It now has approximately 2,500 year-round residents. 
         Many of our guests come back year after year to be welcomed with the old-fashioned Southern hospitality 
         of Kure Beach.  We are mostly a residential community, dotted with many fine oceanfront and ocean view 
         motels, condos and cottages to suit all tastes and budgets, including many luxurious beach homes. 
          Of course, our beach is wide open and unspoiled; with all the elbowroom you could want for sunbathing, 
          strolling, shelling, surfing or fishing.  </p>
